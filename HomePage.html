                My name is Cengizjohn Arslan and I am a first year Computer Programming Student at Humber College. 
                I enjoy going to the gym, playing video games, going on walks and watching sports (mainly mma and football/soccer).
                I currently work as a Window Coverings Installer, but also as a grass cutter during the spring/summer and as a 
                snow plower during the winter.
